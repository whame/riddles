Solution to the two burning yarns
======================================

If you burn one piece from two ends, it takes 30 seconds to burn. 

Now, you can burn one of them from two sides, and at the same time, burn one side of the other one. 
When the first one is over (after 30 seconds), you burn the other side of the second one. This way you just counted 45 seconds.

For the 50 seconds, you first burn one piece from two sides and wait until it is over. Now you just counted 30 seconds.
At this moment, cut the second piece, into two pieces. 
Burn the first one from both ends and the second one from one end. 
You wait until one is over, and keep the process going while making sure at any moment, there are three flames that are burning. 
This way, you count 50 seconds.
