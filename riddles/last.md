Last man standing
=================

100 people are standing in a circle. The first person has a sword. He kills the
person next to him (person number two) with the sword and gives the sword to
person number three. Person number three kills the person next to him (person
number four) and gives the sword to the person after (person number five). They
keep doing this until there is only one man standing.

Knowing these rules, which position in the circle should you choose to
guarrantee your survival?
