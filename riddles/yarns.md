Two burning yarns
==========================

I give you two magical knitting pieces of yarns, those that an old witch gave me at the door step of an old tavern in Bruges.

These pieces of yarns are such that each piece burns in exactly one mintue. 

I also give you as many lighters as you wish.

Can you use these two pieces and count 45 seconds?

How about 50 seconds?
